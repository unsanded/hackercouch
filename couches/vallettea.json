We live in a big house with a huge garden. We can offer a couch but it is in the livingroom. If you need to work I can introduce you to my coworking space.<br />\nDonâ€™t expect not to eat with us (good wines goes with good food !). I strongly recommend summer periods where we spend most of our evening outside in the garden doing barbecues or planchas.<br />\nThere is an atelier with lots of tools and all you need to solder (electronics but also metal, I made my own bike there.)<br />\nThe wifi is shity.</p>\n","relative_path":"_json/vallettea.md","url":"/couches/vallettea.json","collection":"json"}
